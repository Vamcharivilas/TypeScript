TypeScript:
By definition, “Typescript is JavaScript for application-scale development.”
TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. It was
designed by Anders Hejlsberg designer of C# at Microsoft. TypeScript is both
a language and a set of tools. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript
compiled to JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some
additional features.

Features of Type Script:
Type is just Java Script:
TypeScript starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript. Typescript
adopts the basic building blocks of your program from JavaScript. Hence,
you only need to know JavaScript to use TypeScript. All TypeScript code is
converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the purpose of execution.
Java Script is TypeScript:
This means that any valid .js file can be renamed to .ts and compiled with
other TypeScript files.
TypeScript is Portable:
TypeScript is portable across browsers, devices, and operating systems. It
can run on any environment that JavaScript runs on. Unlike its counterparts,
TypeScript doesn’t need a dedicated VM or a specific runtime environment to
execute.
